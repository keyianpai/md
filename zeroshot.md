- pre-training a simple neural language model for dense vector representations of words
- pre-train a deep neural network for visual object recognition
- construct a deep visual-semantic model by taking the lower layers of the pre-trained visual object recognition network and re-training them to predict the vector representation of the image label text as learned by the language mode
