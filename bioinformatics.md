# The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP) of Nucleotide Sequence Variation

- The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) is a public-domain archive for a broad collection of simple genetic polymorphisms
  - single-base nucleotide substitutions (also known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs)
  -  small-scale multi-base deletions or insertions (also called deletion insertion polymorphisms or DIPs)
  - retroposable（可重组） element insertions and microsatellite repeat variations (also called short tandem repeats or STRs)
  > short tandem repeats or STRs,短串联重复序列
  - Each dbSNP entry includes the sequence context of the polymorphism (i.e., the surrounding sequence), the occurrence frequency of the polymorphism (by population or individual), and the experimental method(s), protocols, and conditions used to assay（测定） the variation
-  physical mapping, functional analysis, pharmacogenomics, association studies, and evolutionary studies  
   - In the physical mapping of nucleotide sequences, variations are used as positional markers
   - Variations that occur in functional regions of genes or in conserved non-coding regions might cause significant changes in the complement of transcribed sequences
   - The associations between variations and complex genetic traits are more ambiguous than simple, single-gene mutations that lead to a phenotypic change

Flanking sequence The untranscribed regions at the 5′ or 3′ ends of a transcribed gene.
